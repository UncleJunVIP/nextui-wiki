## About NextUI

NextUI is a custom firmware (CFW) for the TrimUI Brick & Smart Pro retro gaming handhelds.

It was started by [@ro8inmorgan](https://github.com/ro8inmorgan) as a fork of the popular MinUI CFW so they could
implement changes that were determined to be outside the scope of the original project.

NextUI quickly took off and became especially popular on the TrimUI devices.

## Features

NextUI officially supports the TrimUI Brick and TrimUI Smart Pro gaming handhelds.

It features a rebuilt emulation engine and tons of added features outlined below.<br />
<small>Note: For other devices we recommend checking out [MinUI](https://github.com/shauninman/MinUI).</small>

- Fixed both screen tearing and sync stutter problems of MinUI by rebuilding the emulator engine core
- Game switcher menu (Onion OS style) by [@frysee](https://github.com/frysee)
- High quality audio, due to advanced resampling engine
  using [libsamplerate](https://github.com/libsndfile/libsamplerate) (with quality/performance setting per emulator)
- Much lower latency (average 20ms, 1 frame of 60fps)
- Game art/media support
- Game time tracker!
- Cheats support
- Overlays support!
- Dynamic cpu speed scaling (keeps your device cool and extends battery life, but gives the performance right when
  needed)
- Custom bootlogos contributed by [@SolvalouArt](https://bsky.app/profile/solvalouart.bsky.social)
- Color and font settings to customize the NextUI interface
- Menu animations
- LED control, change colors, effects, brightness
- LED indicators, low battery, stand by, charging (brightness can be set seperately)
- Haptic feedback in the menu by [@ExonakiDev](https://github.com/exonakidev)
- Ambient LED mode, the LEDS act like Ambient light TV's for extra immersion, configurable per emulator
- Screen color temperature and brightness controls
- Deep Sleep mode, gives instant ON and avoids the overheat bug on the Brick
  by [@zhaofengli](https://github.com/zhaofengli)
- Battery Monitoring including history graph and time left prediction
- Scrolling animated titles for longer game names
- Updated and optimized build emulation cores
- Rumble strength fixed and is now variable as used by the games
- FBNeo Arcade screen rotation
- PAL Mode
- Next font supports CJK for JP/CN etc rom names
- Lot of other smaller fixes and optimizations

# Future Plans

- Bluetooth and wifi integrated
- Configurable FN and switch buttons
- More compatibility testing with different emulators and fix/improve if necessary
- RetroAchievements
- Shaders
- Probably we think of a lot of other stuff a long the way to add :D
- Once everything is to my liking I will look into porting this to more devices
- Clean up all MinUI code and strip it from all stuff for legacy devices etc.
